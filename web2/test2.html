            <img src="images/b21.jpeg" width="500" height="300">
            <p>The Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider is an American strategic bomber under development for the United States Air Force (USAF) by Northrop Grumman. As part of the Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) program, it is to be a long-range, stealth intercontinental strategic bomber for the USAF, able to deliver conventional and thermonuclear weapons. The Air Force intends the B-21 to replace the Rockwell B-1 Lancer and Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit by 2040, and possibly the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress after that.</p>
            <p>The Air Force began planning for the B-21 in 2011[5] and awarded the major development contract in 2015.[6] The B-21 is expected to make its first flight in 2023 and enter service by 2027.[7][8] Many aspects of the B-21 program are highly classified; the program is designated as a special access program.[4] </p>

            <p>The Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit, also known as the Stealth Bomber, is an American heavy strategic bomber designed for penetrating dense anti-aircraft defenses. It is capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons and has a unique flying-wing design. The B-2 Spirit is known for its advanced stealth technology, making it nearly invisible to enemy radar.</p>

            <img src="images/b52.jpg" width="500" height="300">
            <p>The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress is an American long-range, subsonic strategic bomber. It has been in service with the United States Air Force since the 1950s and is one of the most iconic bomber aircraft in history. The B-52 has been adapted for various roles over the years and continues to serve as a vital part of the U.S. strategic bomber fleet.</p>
            <P>Beginning with the successful contract bid in June 1946, the B-52 design evolved from a straight wing aircraft powered by six turboprop engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines and swept wings. The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952. Built to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War–era deterrence missions, the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36 Peacemaker. A veteran of several wars, the B-52 has dropped only conventional munitions in combat. The B-52's official name Stratofortress is rarely used; informally, the aircraft has become commonly referred to as the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fucker/Fella).</P>

            <img src="images/b1.jpg" width="500" height="300">
            <p>The Rockwell B-1B Lancer, commonly known as the B-1, is an American supersonic variable-sweep wing, heavy bomber. It is capable of carrying a variety of weapons and has been used in both conventional and nuclear roles. The B-1B Lancer is known for its speed and versatility, making it a valuable asset to the United States Air Force.</p>
            <p>The B-1 was first envisioned in the 1960s as a platform that would combine the Mach 2 speed of the B-58 Hustler with the range and payload of the B-52, and was meant to ultimately replace both bombers. After a long series of studies, Rockwell International (now part of Boeing) won the design contest for what emerged as the B-1A. This version had a top speed of Mach 2.2 at high altitude and the ability to fly for long distances at Mach 0.85 at very low altitudes. The combination of the high cost of the aircraft, the introduction of the AGM-86 cruise missile that flew the same basic speed and distance, and early work on the B-2 stealth bomber reduced the need for the B-1. The program was canceled in 1977, after the B-1A prototypes had been built.</p>

            <p>The Tupolev Tu-95 is a Russian turboprop-powered strategic bomber and missile platform. It is often referred to as the "Bear" by NATO. The Tu-95 is one of the most iconic strategic bombers in the Russian Air Force and is known for its distinctive propeller-driven design.</p>
            <p>The aircraft has four Kuznetsov NK-12 engines with contra-rotating propellers. It is the only propeller-powered strategic bomber still in operational use today. The Tu-95 is one of the loudest military aircraft, particularly because the tips of the propeller blades move faster than the speed of sound.[1] Its distinctive swept-back wings are set at an angle of 35°. The Tu-95 is the only propeller-driven aircraft with swept wings that has been built in large numbers.</p>
